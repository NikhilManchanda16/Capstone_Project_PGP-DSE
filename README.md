Title : Exploration and Modelling of Factors Leading to Readmission of Diabetes Patients

Problem : One of the problems faced in treatment of diabetes by the healthcare industry in U.S. is readmission of patients within 30 days, which is often due to improper diagnosis and treatment. 

Importance : In 2011, American hospitals spent over $41 billion on diabetic patients who got readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Patient re-admission cost is generally more than the healthcare premium paid by the consumer especially in US healthcare industry Being able to determine factors that lead to higher readmission in such patients, and correspondingly being able to predict which patients will get readmitted can help hospitals save millions of dollars while improving quality of care.

Value Addition : We aim at building a model for the prediction of the fact that the diabetic patient will probably be re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge or not and recognizing patterns that explain re-admission so that treatment and diagnosis criteria can be improved and millions of dollars can be saved while improving quality of healthcare.
